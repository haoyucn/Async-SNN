Asynchorinized Spiking Neural Network  
1. Developed a spiking neural network (SNN) to study biologically inspired temporal learning and memory efficiency.  
2. Achieved O(1) memory complexity for sequence learning compared to O(T) in standard backpropagation, demonstrating potential for low-power continual learning systems.  
3. for the accuracy report in paper, please go to 'test_NetworkName.ipynb'.  
4. for space and time consumption, run "python -m memory_profiler [file name]".  
    to run the file, you need to install memory_profiler, you can use "pip3 install -U memory_profiler".

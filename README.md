Asynchorinized Spiking Neural Network

1. for the accuracy report in paper, please go to 'test_NetworkName.ipynb'.

2. for space and time consumption, run "python -m memory_profiler [file name]".
    to run the file, you need to install memory_profiler, you can use "pip3 install -U memory_profiler".

    "periodsPerInput" in "timesSpaceUsage[network name].py" corresponding to sequence length in the report
